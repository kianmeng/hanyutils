defmodule Pinyin do
  @moduledoc """
  Utilities to deal with pinyin syllables and groups thereof.

  The main goal of this module is to provide functions to manipulate strings that contain pinyin
  words, which are potentially mixed with other content.  Users of this module can use `read/2`,
  `read!/2` or `sigil_p/2` to parse a string and turn it into a `t:pinyin_list/0`. Afterwards,
  such a list can be converted into a "numbered" or a "marked" string. Numbered strings are
  created with `numbered/1`; in this representation, tone marks are not added to the pinyin
  syllable, numbers are used to indicate the tone instead. When `marked/1` is used, pinyin is
  printed with tone marks.

  When a string is parsed with `read/2`, it is converted into a list containing strings and
  `t:t/0` structs. These structs encode pinyin syllables. Users of this module generally do not
  need to worry about manipulating these structs directly, but they are exposed for users who want
  to handle pinyin using custom logic. `create/2`, `from_marked/1` and `from_numbered/1` can be
  used to directly create a pinyin struct for a given syllable. Like `t:pinyin_list/0`, `t:t/0`
  structs can be converted to strings with `numbered/1` and `marked/1`.

  Create a pinyin struct (`t:t/0`) from a string with tone marks.

  this function should only be used for a single pinyin word.

  @doc """
  Read a string and convert it into a list of string and pinyin structs.

  This function reads a string containing pinyin mixed with normal text. The output of this
  function is a list of strings and pinyin structs. White space and punctuation will be separated
  from other strings.

  The input string may contain tone-marked (e.g. "nǐ") pinyin, numbered ("ni3") pinyin or a mix
  thereof (nǐ hao3). Note that in numbered pinyin mode tone numerals __must not__ be separated
  from their word. For instance, "ni3" will be correctly parsed as "nǐ", "ni 3" will not. When
  tone marked pinyin is used the tone must be marked on the correct letter. For instance, hǎo will
  parse correctly, haǒ will not; we recommend the use of numbered pinyin if there is uncertainty
  about the location of the tone mark.

  ## Parse Modes

  By default, this function only accepts strings which consists exclusively of pinyin, whitespace
  and puncutation. Parsing any text that cannot be interpreted as pinyin will result in an error:

      iex> Pinyin.read("Ni3hao3!")
      {:ok, [%Pinyin{tone: 3, word: "Ni"}, %Pinyin{tone: 3, word: "hao"}, "!"]}

      iex> Pinyin.read("Ni3hao3, hello!")
      {:error, "hello!"}

  This behaviour can be tweaked if pinyin mixed with regular text needs to be parsed; this can be
  done by passing a `mode` to this function. There are 3 available modes:

  - `:exclusive`: The default. Every character (except white space and punctuation) is
    interpreted as pinyin. If this is not possible, an error is returned.
  - `:words`: Any word (i.e. a continuous part of the string that does not contain whitespace or
    punctuation) is either interpreted as a sequence of pinyin syllables or as non-pinyin text. If
    a word contains any characters that cannot be interpreted as pinyin, the whole word is
    considered to be non-pinyin text. This mode does not return errors.
  - `:mixed`: Any word can contain a mixture of pinyin and non-pinyin characters. The read
    function will interpret anything it can interpret as pinyin as pinyin and leaves the other
    text unmodified. This is mainly useful to mix characters and pinyin. It is not recommended to
    use this mode to mix pinyin and normal text. This mode does not return errors.

  The following examples show the use of all three modes:

      iex> Pinyin.read("Ni3hao3!", :exclusive)
      {:ok, [%Pinyin{tone: 3, word: "Ni"}, %Pinyin{tone: 3, word: "hao"}, "!"]}

      iex> Pinyin.read("Ni3hao3, hello!", :exclusive)
      {:error, "hello!"}

      iex> Pinyin.read("Ni3好hao3, hello!", :exclusive)
      {:error, "Ni3好hao3, hello!"}

      iex> Pinyin.read("Ni3hao3!", :words)
      {:ok, [%Pinyin{tone: 3, word: "Ni"}, %Pinyin{tone: 3, word: "hao"}, "!"]}

      iex> Pinyin.read("Ni3hao3, hello!", :words)
      {:ok, [%Pinyin{tone: 3, word: "Ni"}, %Pinyin{tone: 3, word: "hao"}, ", ", "hello", "!"]}

      iex> Pinyin.read("Ni3好hao3, hello!", :words)
      {:ok, ["Ni3好hao3",  ", ", "hello", "!"]}

      iex> Pinyin.read("Ni3hao3!", :mixed)
      {:ok, [%Pinyin{tone: 3, word: "Ni"}, %Pinyin{tone: 3, word: "hao"}, "!"]}

      iex> Pinyin.read("Ni3hao3, hello!", :mixed)
      {:ok, [%Pinyin{tone: 3, word: "Ni"}, %Pinyin{tone: 3, word: "hao"}, ", ", %Pinyin{word: "he"}, "l", %Pinyin{word: "lo"}, "!"]}

      iex> Pinyin.read("Ni3好hao3, hello!", :mixed)
      {:ok, [%Pinyin{tone: 3, word: "Ni"}, "好",  %Pinyin{tone: 3, word: "hao"}, ", ", %Pinyin{word: "he"}, "l", %Pinyin{word: "lo"}, "!"]}

  When `:mixed` or `:word` mode is used, it is possible some words are incorrectly identified as
  pinyin. This is generally not a problem for users who just wish to use `marked/1` or
  `numbered/1` on the result of `read/2`, since pinyin syllables with no tone are printed as is.

  ## Capitalization and -r suffix

  This function is able to read capitalized and uppercase pinyin strings. That is, strings such as
  "Ni3hao3", "NI3HAO3" and "NI3hao3" are accepted. However, pinyin words with mixed capitalization
  are not recognized:

      iex> Pinyin.read("Hao3")
      {:ok, [%Pinyin{tone: 3, word: "Hao"}]}

      iex> Pinyin.read("HAO3")
      {:ok, [%Pinyin{tone: 3, word: "HAO"}]}

      iex> Pinyin.read("HaO3")
      {:error, "HaO3"}

  Finally, this function does not detect the _-r_ suffix. Users of the library should take care to
  fully write out _er_ instead. That is, do not write "zher", use "zheer" instead.

      iex> Pinyin.read("zher")
      {:error, "zher"}

      iex> Pinyin.read("zheer")
      {:ok, [%Pinyin{word: "zhe"}, %Pinyin{word: "er"}]}
